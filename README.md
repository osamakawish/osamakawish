### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**osamakawish/osamakawish** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. -->

ðŸ”­ Check out [my portfolio](https://www.osamakawish.com/)! I will keep all updates regarding my programming and math related work and projects there.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything! I love finance, math, games, and have experience with graphic design. I also have a bit of an interest in blogging.

ðŸ“« How to reach me: [Email me](mailto:osamakawish@gmail.com)! Other contact information can be found via [my about me page](https://osamakawish.com/about).

âš¡ Fun fact: There's a lot of parallels between Ancient Indian philosophy and Western (Enlightenment and Ancient Greek) philosophy.

I generally enjoy the entire development process: The planning, the UI designing, the learning, the programming, etc.
