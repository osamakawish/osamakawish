### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**osamakawish/osamakawish** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. -->

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an application that would help make math animations (FunctionPlots).

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced .Net/C#. Trying to also work on other people's code. I plan to learn web dev soon.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything! I love finance, math, games, and have experience with graphic design. I also have a bit of an interest in blogging.

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with teaching people about C# or advanced mathematical concepts. 

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about C#, math, life, etc.

ðŸ“« How to reach me: [Email me](mailto:osamakawish@gmail.com).

âš¡ Fun fact: There's a lot of parallels between Ancient Indian philosophy and Western (Enlightenment and Ancient Greek) philosophy.

I generally enjoy the entire development process: The planning, the UI designing, the learning, the programming, etc.
