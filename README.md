### Hi there 👋

<!--
**osamakawish/osamakawish** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

🔭 I’m currently working on a Windows Forms application for a Sudoku variation. Also working on a stock market social media application similar to StockWits.

🌱 I’m currently learning Unity, .Net/C#, WPF, Windows Forms, etc. I am also learning to use various APIs in C#. 

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything! I love finance, math, and have experience with graphic design. I also have a bit of an interest in blogging.

🤔 I’m looking for help with teaching people about C# or advanced mathematical concepts. 

💬 Ask me about C#, math, life, etc.

📫 How to reach me: Email me at osamakawish@gmail.com

⚡ Fun fact: There's a lot of parallels between Ancient Indian philosophy with Enlightenment and Ancient Greek philosophy.
